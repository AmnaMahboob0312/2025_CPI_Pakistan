Analysis Description
The 2025 CPI expenditure weights show that Pakistani households allocate the largest portion of their income to basic necessities. Nationally, Food & Non-Alcoholic Beverages (34.5%) and Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas & Fuels (23.63%) together account for more than half of total household expenditure. This indicates that a significant share of income is devoted to essential living costs. In contrast, the smallest expenditure shares are observed in Alcoholic Beverages & Tobacco (1.02%) and Communication (2.21%), reflecting lower relative spending in these categories.

Both rural and urban areas follow the same overall consumption pattern, with differences mainly in proportions. Rural households allocate a higher percentage of income to food, while urban households spend approximately 10% less on food and redirect that share toward housing, electricity, and gas — likely due to higher utility and accommodation costs in urban areas.
